#### [_Netflix Stock Price Predictor_](https://github.com/ShivaSaiV/TensorFlow-Development/blob/main/Netflix%20Stock%20Price%20Predictor.ipynb): In progress
Analyzed Netflix stock data from 2002-2020. Creating a model to forecast future stock price.



## _**TensorFlow for Deep Learning**_:

#### - [_Clothing Type_](https://github.com/ShivaSaiV/TensorFlow-Development/blob/main/TensorFlow%20for%20Deep%20Learning/(Neural%20Network)%20ClothingType.ipynb): Neural network
Developed and trained a neural network model with 60,000 training examples and 10,000 testing examples from fashion MNIST dataset for classifying images of clothing. Flattened images (28 * 28 pixels) into 1d vectors with 784 elements. Added a layer with 128 neurons, another layer with 512 neurons, and an output layer with 10 units (10 labels) that includes softmax activation function for probability distribution. This model achieved over 91% accuracy on training data and over 88% accuracy on testing data. 

#### - [_Celsius to Fahrenheit_](https://github.com/ShivaSaiV/TensorFlow-Development/blob/main/TensorFlow%20for%20Deep%20Learning/CelsiustoFahrenheit.ipynb): 
Very simple model (Dense network) with single layer (first model) and 3 layers (new model) to convert values from Celsius to Fahrenheit. 



## _**ML with Python Course**_:
    
#### - [_Flower Classifier_](https://github.com/ShivaSaiV/TensorFlow-Development/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20with%20Python/FlowersClassifier.py): 
DNN-based Iris Species classification algorithm to distinguish flowers based on measurements
  
#### - [_Titanic Survival_](https://github.com/ShivaSaiV/TensorFlow-Development/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20with%20Python/TitanicSurvival.py): 
Used Linear Regression with estimators to predict survival rates
